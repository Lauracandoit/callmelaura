              A and C<br />
                 <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
            While defining the lead process, both marketing and sales departements can identify at which stage a lead can be considerd Qualified. Many organizations pass marketing leads to inside sales only if a lead reaches a lead-score threshold. 
            Before passing on a lead, it is a best practice to make sure that the lead has a defined need, the necessary budget, the purchasing authority, and an appropriate purchasing timeline. If not, the lead should continue to be nurtured within marketing. An AppExchange app can be downloaded for lead scoring. Using Data loader or a record type would not help in this situation.
