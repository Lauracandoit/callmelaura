2. After internal analysis, the VP of Sales has concluded that the closure of an Opportunity is directly proportional to the number of Activities per week. A weekly report needs to be generated and it should contain the numberof different types of Activities, split across the Opportunity record types that company has. What is the best way to meet this requirement? <br/> 
Choose 1 answer: <br />
a. A report in matrix format scheduled as a weekly email.  <br />
b. A report in Summary format schedule as a weekly email.  <br />
c. A report in Tabular format scheduled as a weekly email.  <br />

                  a. <br />
                 <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
                  The standard 'Activities with Opportunities report' type can be used to generate this metric. A matrix reprot can be created by grouping the columns by  'Opportunity record type' and grouping the rows by 'Task subtype'. The report can be scheduled as a weekly email to the VP of Sales.

3. The admin of Cosmic Solution has created a report that shows accounts by region. Each user who accesses this report should only be able to view the accounts that they own. Which relative value shoould be used when setting up a personalized report filter for this requirement?  <br />
Choose 1 answer: <br />
a. $USER <br />

              A. <br/>
                 <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
                  A personalized report filter can be created by defining a filter on a user field using a relative value that personalizes the results for each user who views the report. When setting up a filter on a user field, such as Account Owner, $User can be selected as the relative value. This changes the filter value to the currently signed in user. Only user-related fields support this feature. 

                  $currentuser and $owner are invalid relative values

              b <br/>
                 <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
                  Field History Tracking can be enabled on the Opportunity object to create field history reports that show old and new values of fields such as Stage. Field Audit trail is used to set field history retention policies. Although reporting snapshots can be used to report on historical data, it is used to report on records regularly at a specific time, such as closed Opportunities at 5 PM every day. Installing an AppExchange package is not required for field history reports.

                 <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
            The addtendess field can be added to the Event Page layout to allow users to add Salesforce users, contact, person accounts, and leads to the events that they create in lightning experience. Setting up Lightning Sync is only required to send invitations to attendees and receive their responses. There is also no setting in 'Activity Settings' that can be enabled to allow users to add attendees

6. Cosmic Solutions has implemented Salesforce with users' mobility requirements in mind. Sales reps are required to check their devices whenever they are out to meet customers and should update the records with details about their visit as and when it happens. How can the Salesforce Admin monitor usage and adoption of the Salesforce mobile app?<br />
Choose 2 answers: <br />
a. By monitoring Salesforce mobile app login activity of all users using reports such as 'Salesforce for iOS and Android Adoption Reports and dashboards'<br />
b. By monitoring Salesforce mobile app login activity of all users under Setup > Company Information<br />
c. By monitoring Salesforce mobile app login activity of all users under Setup > Security > Network Access<br />
d. By monitoring Salesforce mobile app login activity of all users under Setup > Connected App OAuth Usage<br />

<details>
              <summary style={{ color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold' }}> Result</summary>
              <div >
              A and D<br/>
                 <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
                Salesforce mobile app is a connected app that uses OAuth to verify users. For monitoring purposes, Salesforce tracks the OAuth connection history for users, which helps identify who is accessing the app. Under Setup > Connected Apps OAuth Usage, details are available regarding how many users accessed Salesforce for iOS/Android, when the initial connection was made, and the date/time the mobile app was last used. Salesforce Admin can also create reports and dashboards based on login history and connected apps usage to quickly access details on who logged in, when, and using which application, all in one place. Free apps on AppExchange can assist with the same.  
  Note: User's Salesforce mobile app login history data is not available under 'Setup > Company Information' or 'Setup > Security > Network Access'.

              B<br/>

                 <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
            A gauge can be used to represent a single metric across a named scale. It is useful for showing progress towards a goal. Charts, on the other hand, are used to show data graphically.

9. Cosmic Furniture uses Salesforce and is looking for a solution that gives sales reps the ability to nurture their prospects using consistent and predefined sales outreach activities. Which of the following are valid features of sales engagement that would meet this requirement?  <br />
Choose 3 answers: <br />
a. A scheduled sequence of prospect outreach activities can be created using call scripts and email templates  <br />
b. The 'My Feed' tab can be accessed to view the last 180 days of engagement with prospects  <br />

<details>
              <summary style={{ color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold' }}> Result</summary>
              <div >
              C, D, E<br/>
                 <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
              Sales engagement features Cadence Builder, which can be used to create scheduled sequences of outreach activities called 'Cadences'. While creating a cadence, the type of sales outreach step can be selected. It can be Call, Email, LinkedIn Step, Custom Step, or Wait. Both sales managers and reps can add contacts, leads, and person accounts to a cadence. Records can be added to a cadence from a record detail page, list view, or report. The 'My List' tab allows sales reps to tackle personal, one-off activities that aren't associated with cadences.  
    Sales reps can use the "work queue" in the Lightning Sales Console to work on the assigned leads. The 'Cadences' tab shows the activities defined by sales managers. The "My Feed" tab shows the last 30 days of engagement with prospects.

10. Cosmic Travel Service has two groups of sales reps that would like to use a dashboard to access information about Opportunities. The first group would like a way to quickly access a dashboard that shows the total number of "Closed won" Opportunities with an amount greater than or equal to 100000. Similarly, the second group would like quick access to the number of Opportunities in the "Negotiation" stage with an amount greater than or equal to 10000. The system admin of the company has decided to use a single dashboard to meet both the requirements. She has created a dashboard with a funnel chart Component that shows the number of Opportunities by stage. What solution should be utilized to give the sales reps quick access to the number of Opportunities according to their requirement? <br />
Choose 1 answer: <br />
a. Define two filters and create two custom dashboard URLs, each containing filter parameters <br />
b. Define two filters and create a duplicate dashboard that uses different defult filter value<br />
c. Define two conditional filters that filter the dashboard information based on the running user<br />
d. Use two funnel chart components on the dashboard to show the number of Opportunities<br />
<details>
              <summary style={{ color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold' }}> Result</summary>
              <div >
              A <br/>
                 <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
              Two customer dashboard URLs, each containing two filter parameters, can be created for this use case. Based on 2 filters defined on the dashboard, each URL can contain one filter parameter with a value for the 'Closed Won' or 'Negotiation' stage and a second filter parameter with a value for the required amount of 100000 or 10000. The first URL can display only 'Closed Won' Opportunities with an amount greater than or equal to 100000 and can be shared with the first group of sales reps. The second URL can display only Opportunities in the 'Negotiation' stage with an amount greater than or equal to 10000 and can be shared with the second group of sales reps. 
              A sales rep who access the URL would see the dashboard with the filters already set. The URL (with the filtered detail appropriate for the sales rep group) can be provided as a clickable link from a Salesforce page. <br />
              It is unnecessary to create a duplicate dashboard for the 2 requirements, especially since the admin would like to use a single dashboard filter. Two funnel chart components should not be used since the sales reps should only see the required information. It is not possible to define a 'conditional filter' for a dashboard
              </div>

11. A sales rep working at Cosmic Software Solutions uses sales dialer to make calls from Salesforce. She would like to reduce the time spent leaving voice mail messages when a customer is unavailable by using prerecorded voicemail messages. Which of the following statements are true about using this feature of Sales Dialer? <br />
Choose 1 answer: <br />
a. A keyboard shortcut can be pressed to leave a prerecorded voicemail message<br />
b. Up to 10 incoming voicmail messages can be stored for each user<br />
c. With the voicemail drop feature, each message can be up to 5 minutes long. <br />
d. voicemail drop settings can be selected from the call panel to record a voicemail message<br />
<details>
              <summary style={{ color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold' }}> Result</summary>
              <div >
              D<br/>
                 <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
              To record a voicemail message, reps can select 'Voicemail Drop settings' from the call panel or their personal settings. 
              With the voicemail drop feature, each message can be up to one minute long. Users can store u p to 20 voicemail messages in Salesforce. During a call with a customer or prospect, an icon needs to be clicked in order to drop a pre-record voicemail message; keyboard shortcuts cannot be used for that.
              </div>
        </details>  

12. Sales Cloud was recently implemented at Cosmic Freight tools. The sales director of the company is interested in measuring adoption related to sales cloud usage by the sale reps. Which of the following reports would provide useful information?  <br />
Choose 2 answers: <br />
a. Total value of opportunities won by each sales rep<br />
b. Total number of reports created by each sales rep<br />
c. Total number of logins by each sales rep<br />
d. Total number of accounts created by each sales rep<br />
<details>
              <summary style={{ color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold' }}> Result</summary>
              <div >
              C, D<br/>
                 <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
               The total number of logins is the first measurement of adoption when Salesforce implementation has just been started. On the other hand, the number of accounts created would indicate that the sales reps are using Salesforce and not merely logging in without doing anything. The Salesforce Adoption Dashboards can be downloaded from the AppExchange for more examples of metrics to measure adoption related to Sales Cloud usage. <br />
               The total value of won opportunities would be useful to understand the impact on business performance. The total number of reports created would not necessarily allow measuring adoption related to Sales Cloud usage.

13. A forecast manager would like to analyze how accurately the sales team is forecasting by looking at the changes in the forecast amounts over a quarter. What steps would be required to report on this? <br />
Choose 2 answers: <br />
a. Configure the display options on the Forecasts page to show changes<br />
b. Enable Historical trending for forecasting items<br />
c. Create a new custom report type to include Forecast history<br />
d. Create a forecast history report using an existing report type<br />
<details>
              <summary style={{ color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold' }}> Result</summary>
              <div >
              B, D<br/>
                 <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
               A report on how forecast amounts have changed can be created by enabling Historical trending for 'forecasting items' and creating a report based on the 'Forecasting items with historical trending' report type. Historical trending can be enabled for "forecasting items' only if collaborative forecasting has been enabled.  <br />

               There is no need to create a new custom report type. 'Show changes n the last 7 days' is available as a display option on the forecasts page, but will not be able to show changes in the forecast amounts over a quarter.

        </details>  

14. The sales director of Cosmic Enterprises would like to view the number of follow-ups performed for each opportunity to understand if the number influences the opportunity closure rate. Which reporting solution should be recommended to meet this requirement?   <br />
Choose 1 answer: <br />
a. Create a custom report based on a custom report based on a report type with 'Opportunities' as the primary object and 'Activities' as the related object. <br />
b. Create a roll-up summary field to count the number of activities related to opportunities and create a custom opportunity report that includes the field<br />
c. Create a custom report based on a custom report type with 'Activities' as the primary object and 'Opportunities' as the related object<br />
d. Use the team performance dashboard in revenue insights, and view the 'Activities completed' and 'win rate%' metrics<br />

              <div >
              A<br/>
                 <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
              A custom report can be created using a custom report type with 'Opportunities' as the primary object and activities as the related object <br />

              'Activities' cannot be the primary object when creating a custom report type with opportunities. A roll-up summary field would not work since a master-detail relationship does not exist between activities and opportunities. The team performance dashboard can provide useful information based on the metrics, but it will not be able to providethe data per opportunity.

15. The sales manager at Cosmic Solutions wants a report on campaigns that show their influences on the number of opportunities and the amount of revenue. What report should be run? <br />

b. A report with the standard report type 'campaigns with influenced Opportunities'<br />
c. A report with the standard report type 'Opportunities with influenced Campaigns'<br />
d. A report with the standard report type 'Campaigns with a filter for opportunities' <br />

16. If an organization is using cumulative forecast rollups, what is true regarding the Opportunity amounts included in the 'Open Pipeline' forecast? <br />
Choose 2 answers<br />
a. It does not include amounts from closed Opportunities<br />
b. It does not include amounts from Opportunities under the 'Omitted' category<br />
c. It only includes amounts from all Opportunities in the Pipeline category<br />
d. It excludes amounts from Opportunities closing after 90 days<br />

              A, B<br/>
                 <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
               The 'Open Pipeline' forecast includes amounts from all open Opportunities except those under the 'Omitted' and 'Closed' forcast categories. It reflects the sum of the Opportunities under the 'Pipeline', 'Best Case', and 'Commit' categories. <br />
               It does not include closed Opportunities, and it does not involve any time-baesed criteria. If the 'Most Likely' forecast category has been added, then opportunities under that category will be included as well.

17. A Sales Manager has noticed that certain Opportunities are supposed to close this month, but they are not being incorporated into the forecast. The organization currently uses a forecast type based on Opportunity revenue, and the 'Close Date' values are correct for this month. What could be the reason behind this issue? <br />
Choose 1 answer: <br />
a. The Opportunity is in the incorrect territory<br />
b. There are Opportunity Splits on these Opportunity records<br />
c. The 'Forecast Category' value on the Opportunity record is 'Omitted' <br />
d. Opportunity stages have not been correlated to forecast categories  yet. <br />
<details>
              <summary style={{ color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold' }}> Result</summary>
              <div >
              C<br/>
                 <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
              Opportunbity splits and territory management are not related to the monthly forecasts. Selecting a forecast category is required when creating an Opportunity stage, and existing stages are already correlated with forecast categories.  <br />
              The only potential reason for this issue is that the Opportunities the manager believes should go into the monthly forecast have the forecast category set as Omitted

18. A public group of sales representatives who work for Cosmic Innovation would like to view a sales dashboard that shows metrics related to their performance in the sales department. They do not need to edit the dashboard components or the underlying reports. What should a Sales Cloud consultant recommend for this requirement? <br />
Choose 2 answers: <br />
a. Grant 'View' acccess to the dashboard folder that contains the sales dashboard<br />
b. Assign 'Run Reports' permission to the sales representatives using a permission set<br />
c. Assign 'View Dashboards' permission to the sales representatives using a permission set<br />

              A and B<br/>
                 <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
              To allow the sales representatives to view the sales dashboard, the 'Run Reports' permission should be assigned to them. It allows users to view reports and dashboards. they should also be given 'View' access to the dashboard folder that contains the sales dashboard, which would allow them to view the dashboards in the folder. <br />
              There is no 'View Dashboards' permission. Granting 'Edit' access to the dashboard folder is unnecessary since the sales reps do not need to edit the dashboard components or underlying reports.

20. Cosmic Gemina is a transportation company that has sales divisions in three countries, namely, Frence, Germany, and Italy.

                 <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
               Each sales manager should be granted the user permission to 'Create and Customize Reports' through a permission set, which  would allow them to create, edit and delete reports in shared folders. The folder needs to be shared with each sales manager, and they need to be given 'Editor' access to the report folder that contains their sales division's performance reports. The 'Editor' access level would allow each sales manager to view, edit, save, rename, and move the reports in the folder.

21. Cosmic Travel Services has two groups of sales reps that would like to use a dashboard to access information about opportunities. The first group would like a way to quickly access a dashboard that shows the total number of
'Closed Won' opportunities with an amount greater than or equal to 100,000. Similarly, the second group would like quick access to the number of opportunities in the 'Negotiation' stage with an amount greater than or equal to 10,000. 
The system administrator of the company has decided to use a single dashboard to meet both the requirements. She has created a dashboard with a funnel chart component that shows the number of opportunities by stage. What solution should be utilized to give the sales reps quick access to the number of opportunities<br />
Choose 1 answer: <br />
a. Define two filters and create a duplicate dashboard that uses different default filter values. <br />
b. Define two filters and create two custom dashboard URLs, each containing filter parameters.<br />
c. Define two conditional filters that filter the dashboard information based on the running user.<br />
d. Use two funnel chart components on the dashboard to show the number of opportunities.<br />
<details>

              B<br/>
                 <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
Two custom dashboard URLs, each containing two filter parameters, can be created for this use case. Based on two filters defined on the dashboard, each URL can contain one filter parameter with a value for the 'Closed Won' or 'Negotiation' stage and a second filter parameter with a value for the required amount of 100,000 or 10,000. The first URL can display only 'Closed Won' opportunities with an amount greater than or equal to 100,000 and can be shared with the first group of sales reps.
The second URL can display only opportunities in the 'Negotiation' stage with an amount greater than or equal to 10,000 and can be shared with the second group of sales reps.
A sales rep who accesses the URL would see the dashboard with the filters already set. The URL (with the filtered detail appropriate for the sales rep group) can be provided as a clickable link from a Salesforce
page.
It is unnecessary to create a duplicate dashboard for the two requirements, especially since the administrator would like to use a single dashboard. It is also not possible to define a default filter value for a dashboard filter. Two funnel chart components should not be used since the sales reps should only see the required information. It is not possible to define a 'conditional filter' for a dashboard.

      Pipeline Inspection is available as part of the Sales Cloud license at no extra cost with Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited editions. It provides sales managers with better visibility of their pipeline by providing information on key metrics (based on the available number and currency fields), opportunities, and weekly changes. Metrics such as new opportunities created, increases or decreases in amounts, and overdue opportunities, can be displayed for the sales teams.
Pipeline views can be created using different filters to help identify areas of concern. Pipeline Inspection users who have the 'Revenue Intelligence User' or the 'Revenue Intelligence Admin' permission set can see the changes to opportunities in different forecast categories over time from the 'Flow' tab. Opportunities of multiple record types can be edited inline in the same list view. Users do not have to filter list views by one record type to edit opportunities inline.
Einstein Deal Insights, powered by Einstein's machine learning capability, predicts the opportunities unlikely to be won in the current month. Lastly, Einstein Conversation Insights and Email Insights are also features of Pipeline Inspection. Einstein Conversation Insights and Email Insights provide sales agents with the information they need to analyze all customer interactions to track deals. These functionalities encompass suggested actions, such as reviewing call and email logs, producing call summaries for voice and video calls, and generating editable summaries to incorporate future actions and client input.

         <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
Historical trend reporting allows day-to-day and week-to-week changes in opportunities, cases, forecasts, and custom objects to be analyzed. Historical trend reporting uses a special custom report type designed to highlight changes between five snapshot dates, such as five business days or five business weeks.
Although a reporting snapshot can also be used for reporting on historical data, it requires creating a new custom object with fields to store records loaded from a source report. After a source report, target object, target object fields, reporting snapshot, and field mapping have been defined, the reporting snapshot needs to be scheduled to run daily, weekly, or monthly so that data from the source report is loaded into the target object. This is what builds the historical data which can be used for reporting. If a reporting snapshot was not set up a month prior, there will be no past data available.
On the other hand, when using historical trend reporting, Salesforce retains historical data for the previous three months plus the current month, which makes it a much easier option to use for this requirement.

44. Cosmic Grocery sells its products to non-profit organizations at a discounted rate. A formula field has been defined on the Opportunity object to show whether the account is for a non-profit organization or a regular customer. A sales manager would like to view a report that shows the opportunities owned by each of his team members, grouped by the type of customer, i.e., non-profit organization or regular customer. Which report format is best to meet the requirement?<br />
Choose 1 answer: <br />
a. Summary report<br />
b. Matrix report<br />
c. Joined report<br />
d. Tabular report<br />

         <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
The phrase 'the opportunities owned by each of his team members, grouped by the type of customer' implies two groupings. Since two groupings are required, a matrix report can be utilized as it would group the data by both rows and columns.
A summary report is less efficient for more than one group. A tabular report does not contain groups of data. Creating a joined report is also unnecessary since there is no need to view multiple blocks of data that provide different views of data.

48. Cosmic Software Solutions has a sales team that consists of dozens of inside sales reps who regularly reach out to prospects to sell the company's software products.

            Sales Engagement is a streamlined solution offered by Salesforce that is tailored to inside sales teams. It includes features such as the Lightning Sales Console, Cadences, Work Queues, and Einstein Lead Scoring. A sales rep can access the Work Queue in the Lightning Sales Console to view a prioritized list of tasks to work on leads, which helps them know exactly what next step to take with each prospect. Einstein Lead Scoring prioritizes the leads based on lead scores and displays the factors behind the scores. Sales managers can use the Cadence Builder to define the sequences of activities to guide the inside sales reps through the best next steps. They can add contacts, leads, or person accounts to a cadence using a record detail page, list view, or report.
Other solutions cannot be used to meet this requirement. Sales Cloud Einstein Insights gives sales reps intelligent information about accounts and opportunities using predictions based on Al. Salesforce Inbox is an email productivity tool that gives sales reps the ability to log emails and events to records, schedule emails to be sent later, insert available times for meetings, etc. Pipeline Inspection provides a consolidated view of pipeline metrics, opportunities, week-to-week changes, and close date predictions.
Note: High Velocity Sales was renamed to Sales Engagement.

Process Builder and Flow Builder are tools that can perform similar functionality, but for the given use case, a Big Deal Alert is simpler to set up and easier to configure. A validation rule is used to validate the data entered by a user on a record and is not used for automating actions like sending an email.

55. Cosmic Whole Foods sells organic food products in various cities of the United States. The company provides home delivery of its products to customers through a team of drivers in each city.

      <div >
      A, C, E <br/>
         <span style={{ color: 'blue', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Explanation: </span> 
    Salesforce Maps is a location intelligence technology offered by Salesforce that allows a company to visualize data, plan territories, track live locations, and optimize routes and schedules. The real-time location of delivery drivers and other assets of an organization can be tracked using Live Tracking.
Drivers can turn on Live Tracking in the Salesforce mobile app and share their location, which allows managers to view their location, trip-related data, and other metrics.
Salesforce Maps can be used on a mobile device to find nearby accounts/customers. Customer locations can be visualized geographically to identify clustered customers and plan delivery routes based on the travel time and distance of each customer.
However, it does not allow a customer to chat with a driver who is en route to the delivery location. Geofencing can be enforced using longitude and latitude coordinates, territory/geographic boundaries like state lines, or proximity to customers, but its purpose is to ensure that drivers aren't traveling outside of their zones. Alerts of any unauthorized travel or movement can be enabled, and follow-up communication can be automated.

57. Cosmic Formata recently implemented Salesforce and has various report and dashboard folders. There are various users from different departments who require access to them, but their level of access should depend on their job functions. For instance, a sales representative should only be able to view the reports in a particular report folder, while a marketer should be able to view and edit the reports.

Choose 1 answer: <br />
a. Create public groups for the sales users and grant 'Viewer',
'Editor' or 'Collaborator' access to each public group based on the job functions of the users in the group.<br />

      There are three possible access levels for report and dashboard folders, namely, 'Viewer', 'Editor', and 'Manager'. For this requirement, a folder's access level can be assigned to a public group based on the job functions of the users in the group. For example, if there's a public group for sales representatives who would like to view reports in a particular report folder, then the group can be granted 'Viewer' access to the report folder.
There is no access level called 'Collaborator'. Permissions in a permission set cannot be used to grant access to specific report and dashboard folders.
Enhanced folder sharing is not used to share report and dashboard folders with sales users directly. It is a setting that can be turned on to convert users' existing folder access levels to use new, more detailed access levels.
